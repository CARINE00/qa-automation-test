ðŸš€ Why I Chose Cypress Instead of Playwright
When starting the test automation for this project, I had to choose a reliable and well-supported tool. After evaluating the options, I decided to use Cypress. Below are the main reasons for this choice:

âœ… 1. Easy to Set Up and Use
Cypress is known for being simple and quick to configure. In just a few minutes, you can start writing and running end-to-end tests. Its syntax is intuitive and well-documented, which helps improve productivity and reduces the learning curve.

ðŸ§ª 2. Native Access to the DOM and Runs in the Browser
Cypress runs directly in the browser, which allows full access to the DOM in real time. This makes it easy to debug tests and visually track the application's behavior during test execution.

ðŸ“¸ 3. Automatic Screenshots and Video on Test Failures
Cypress takes automatic screenshots and can record videos of the test run when a test fails. This helps with debugging and sharing test results with the team.
